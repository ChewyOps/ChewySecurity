Over the course of this project we will stand up an Amazon Web Service Virtual Private Computer to store and encrypt customer PII and PCI at rest and in-transit on a Linux server.  Utilize SEIM/log integration and incorporate cloud monitoring to demonstrate AWS' ability to detect and alert admins via SMS of unauthorized attempts to access data.  Execute a Data Loss Prevention solution to detect and prevent exfiltration of PII/PCI data from an instance.
